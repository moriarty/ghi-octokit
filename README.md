ghi-octokit
===========

I found https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi really awesome. So I forked it. 
I wanted to help and started looking at the issues in the original repo. 
But I'm new to Ruby. And I realized I don't have much time.
Then I found Octokit.rb... and now I'm trying to implement ghi using octokit as a way for me to learn Ruby.
